# Combat: one-on-one pulls, then storm farming

This note describes how the bot fights aggressive residents today, why it
changed, and what comes next. It covers the farm loop in `tasks.py`
(`FarmTask`) and the pull squares that `navigation.py`
(`FarmCircuitTask._new_child`) computes for it.

## The problem

Sera (character level 28, slash weapons 28, Wizardry 10) trains Wizardry with
magic bullet as a finisher. In a live session she died 7 times in 40 minutes,
each time to an orc pack of 2-3 attackers, archers included, while at full
stats. One orc at a time is easy for her; two or three are not.

The old code let packs in through several gaps:

- `ranged_pull` and the Wizardry target filter refused a target only when
  another hostile stood within 2 tiles of it. Orcs detect from about 4 tiles,
  so a neighbour 3-4 tiles away joined the fight.
- Pull squares were checked for clearance only against the spawns the leg
  targets, not against the other residents of the map.
- After a pull she held a 2-4 tile gap for at most 2.5 s, then walked toward
  the target, often into the rest of its pack.

## One-on-one mode (implemented)

### Lone-pull predicate

`FarmTask._lone_target(client, candidate, fight_square)` decides whether a
candidate may be pulled, by spell or bow. It is lone when no other visible
hostile has either of these inside its own detection radius:

- the candidate's position;
- the square she fights from (her pull or anchor square).

A monster's detection radius comes from `aggressive_detection_ranges`, which
the circuit fills from the authored `aggro_radius` of every aggressive
resident on the map; unknown monsters default to 4. A neighbour whose name
marks it as a ranged attacker (see below) counts with a radius of at least 6.
Authored-peaceful creatures are ignored, since they never join a fight.
`ranged_pull` and the single-target Wizardry filter both use this one
predicate. The Wizardry filter still keeps a monster that is beside her or
already coming at her (an active threat), so she never ignores an attacker.

### Clear pull square as the kite anchor

`_new_child` searches the perimeter of each target spawn's `aggro_radius` for
a pull square. Clearance is now measured against every aggressive resident
of the map. Residents whose names contain "archer", "bowman", "slinger" or
"mage" (`RANGED_RESIDENT_MARKERS`) are given a radius of at least 6, because
they shoot from outside their detection range. The chosen squares are passed
to `FarmTask` as `pull_squares`.

When she pulls, the farm records an anchor. It is the pull square of the
target spawn nearest the target, provided that spawn is within 6 tiles of
the target and its pull square within 7 tiles of her. Both distances are
Chebyshev, with no path check, and apply only on the farm map itself.
Otherwise the anchor is the square she stands on. After the pull,
`melee_kite` prefers steps toward the anchor among steps that keep at least
4 tiles from every other hostile; separation still wins over the anchor.
`low_health_retreat` is unchanged except that, for the engaged target's
anchor, it prefers the step toward it when two steps are otherwise equal.

### Wait, then approach only if alone

After a pull she holds at or near the anchor for up to `PULL_WAIT_SECONDS`
(8 s). She steps back toward the anchor if she is off it, and never takes a
step that brings her closer to the target.

- If the target comes within 2 tiles, she fights it normally.
- If it has not come after 8 s, she approaches it only if it is still lone,
  measured at its current position.
- Otherwise she sets it aside for `PULL_SET_ASIDE_SECONDS` (120 s) and picks
  another target. A set-aside only hides the monster from target choice and
  pull candidates. It still counts as a threat throughout. The set-aside
  ends only when it expires or the monster arrives within 2 tiles of her,
  where a melee attacker must be. Standing within its detection radius of
  her does not end it, and while it stands near her its packmates do not
  become targets.

The old 2.5 s fallback that walked toward the target no longer applies to a
pulled target.

The pull mode does not use combat-text attribution. Combat text names an
attacker only by species, so a packmate's arrow ("orc archer hit you") or a
stale line from an orc killed earlier would look like the pulled orc
attacking. So:

- the wait ends only on arrival or the 8 s timeout;
- the set-aside ends only on expiry or arrival;
- a hit while she has no engagement commits her to the nearest threat that
  is neither set aside nor inside a set-aside monster's reach (its detection
  radius, at least 6 for a ranged monster, measured from that monster);
- if no such threat remains but a set-aside monster is visible, she does not
  commit. Healing comes first; otherwise she retreats with
  `low_health_retreat`, which steps away from the visible threats. On a
  neutral farm that retreat counts only monsters matching a named attacker,
  so when it finds none she falls back to the unseen-contact retreat. Its
  pursued-stand rule can still make her fight a packmate that stays
  adjacent through several retreat steps. With no threats in view at all,
  the existing unseen-contact retreat applies.

A ranged pulled target that shoots her therefore waits out the 8 s, and a
set-aside ranged monster is not fought until it closes to 2 tiles or its
120 s set-aside expires. The safety policy (healing and the flee threshold)
and the retreats still react to its damage.

Accepted limit: while she is unengaged, a monster standing within a
set-aside monster's reach is not fought back, unless it comes adjacent and
the pursued-stand rule fires, until the set-aside expires.

### Analyzer ranking (already shipped)

Pull request https://github.com/atrinik/playtester/pull/77 ranks
Wizardry-to-15 spots by running the farm analyzer at the trained skill's
level with `--max-aggro-pack 1`, so the circuit only picks spots where a lone
pull is possible.

## Next phase: storm farming (owner decisions, 2026-10-22)

At Wizardry 15 the single-target restriction should give way to area spells.

- **Purchase.** Buy both firestorm and icestorm from Dunowen in the Wizards'
  Tower (Daffodil, `world_17_2_2` at (5,9)), 5 gold each.
- **Element choice.** Cast whichever spell the monsters are not immune to.
  Ice golems are cold-immune and fire-weak; lava golems are the reverse.
  Firestorm is the default.
- **Play style.** Pure caster: rest to full mana between packs.
- **Spell facts.** A 90° cone about 5 tiles deep, aimed at the exact selected
  target. 13 SP at Wizardry 15, about 1 s to cast, about 11-13 damage per
  monster at Wizardry 15 with Pow 13.
- **Analyzer AoE profile.** Inputs: `--damage-per-attack`, `--attack-delay`,
  `--mana-cost`, `--mana-regen`, `--max-mana`, `--aoe-radius`,
  `--attack-type` and `--simulate-multiple-enemies`.
- **Candidate area.** The Old Outpost. `old_outpost_0101` has 10 ice golems
  (L12) and 11 lava golems (L13); deeper maps go to L27-30.

Open questions:

- The route to Lyondale.
- Storm damage against golem HP: how many casts a pack needs, and whether
  she can afford them from one mana bar.
- Whether one cone can hit the same monster more than once.

## Non-goals

- No change to melee kiting against a target that was not pulled, to the
  pack-split retreat, or to emergency recall.
- No path-level avoidance of archer ranges. The extended radius applies to
  pull-square clearance and the lone-pull check only; patrol avoidance and
  threat detection still use authored radii.
- No AoE behaviour yet. Firestorm already lifts the single-target Wizardry
  filter once she casts it, but pulls still require a lone target.
- No hiding of set-aside monsters from threat handling. A pull set-aside
  hides a monster from target choice only; it stays a threat and is released
  only when it expires or the monster arrives within 2 tiles of her.
